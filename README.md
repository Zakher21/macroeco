macroeco
========

## For the most up-to-date and unittested version of `macroeco` please use the develop branch

Overview
--------

macroeco is a Python package for pattern-based ecological analysis. The package 
was developed at UC Berkeley by Justin Kitzes, Mark Wilber, and Chloe Lewis, 
and is maintained by Justin Kitzes.

There is no separate documentation available yet, although the docstrings for 
various classes and functions are relatively complete. Refer also to the 
software [ecopattern](http://github.com/jkitzes/ecopattern) for examples of the 
package in use.

Installation
------------

Simply clone the macroeco directory to a location on your PYTHONPATH, including 
as a subdirectory of your current work folder. A `setup.py` file is coming in a 
future release.
