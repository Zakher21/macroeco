<h1>SAD Analysis</h1>
<p>This script takes in a dataset(s) and a list of distributions
to which the observed dataset(s)'s SADs will be compared.  The required
parameters for this script are the following: 
</p><p>
'subset' : How one would like to initially subset the data (see DataTable 
class docstring). 
</p><p>
'criteria' : How one would like to divide the dataset when calculating the 
SAD(s). The theoretical distributions are compared against every SAD that is 
generated from the cutting specified in this parameter.  See Patch class 
docstring for details.
</p><p>
'dist_list' : The list of distributions to which one could compare the observed
SAD(s).  The full list of distributions can be found in distributions.py.
</p><p>
For each SAD generated by the divisions specified in criteria, this script
outputs a summary file, a rank-abundance plot, and data file with the
rank-abundance distributions used to build the rank-abundance plot.
