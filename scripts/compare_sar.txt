<h1>Species-Area Relationship Analysis</h1>
<p>This script takes in a dataset(s) and list of curves to which
compare the observed datasets SAR will be compared.  The required parameters
for the script are the following:
</p><p>
'subset' : How one would like to initially subset his data (see DataTable 
class docstring). 
</p><p>
'div_cols' : A tuple of specifying the columns that will be divided during the
sar analysis. e.g. ('x', 'y')
</p><p>
'div_list' : A list of tuples, in the same order as the columns in div_list, that
specify the divisions one would like to make in order to generate the sar.  A
division of (1,1) indicates the whole plot.
</p><p>
'sar_criteria' : This parameter is a dictionary that specifies which column is
the data set is the column is species counts and which column is the column
with species names. e.g. {'spp' : 'species', 'spp_count' : 'count'.  In this case,
column name 'spp' is the species column and column 'spp_count' is the count
column. See Patch method sar() for more info
</p><p>
'curve_list' : A list with the name of the SARCurve objects that will be
compared to the empirical SAR.  If none are given, the empirical SAR is just
plotted on its own.
</p><p>
'names' : List with the desired name of the plot
</p><p>
For each dataset, this script generates a log-log sar plot with the empirical
and theoretical SARs plotted and csv files containing all of the data used to
make the plot.
